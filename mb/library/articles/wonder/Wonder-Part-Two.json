I've done every school project pretty much by myself. When Mom or Dad ask me how things are going in school, I've always said \"good\"—even when it hasn't always been so good. My worst day, worst fall, worst headache, worst bruise, worst cramp, worst mean thing anyone could say has always been nothing compared to what August has gone through.",
                "cn": "所以我习惯了不抱怨，也习惯了不拿小事去烦爸爸妈妈。我习惯了自己解决问题：如何把玩具拼装起来，如何安排我的生活以免错过朋友的生日派对，如何紧跟我的学业以免在课堂上落后。我从没在家庭作业上寻求过帮助。从不需要被提醒去完成一个项目或为考试学习。如果我在学校里某门科目上遇到困难，我就会回家自己研究，直到我自己弄明白为止。我通过上网自学了如何将分数转换为小数。我几乎所有的学校项目都是自己完成的。当爸爸妈妈问我在学校情况如何时，我总是说“很好”——即使情况并非总是那么好。我最糟糕的一天、最惨的一次摔倒、最厉害的头痛、最严重的瘀伤、最剧烈的抽筋、任何人能说的最刻薄的话，与奥古斯特所经历的相比，都一直算不了什么。",

There's one shot of me at my third birthday: Dad's right behind me while Mom's holding the cake with three lit candles, and in back of us are Tata and Poppa, Grans, Uncle Ben, Aunt Kate, and Uncle Po. Everyone's looking at me and I'm looking at the cake. You can see in that picture how I really was the first child, first grandchild, first niece. I don't remember what it felt like, of course, but I can see it plain as can be in the pictures.",

It was one of those dolls that are incredibly lifelike, and I had carried it everywhere for months, changing its diaper, feeding it. I'm told I even made a baby sling for it. The story goes that after my initial reaction to August, it only took a few minutes (according to Grans) or a few days (according to Mom) before I was all over him: kissing him, cuddling him, baby talking to him.

There are new ones, of course. Mom and Dad can read every single one. But I'm having trouble keeping up. And there's a part of me that doesn't want to keep trying: why can't he just say what he's feeling like everyone else? He doesn't have a trache tube in his mouth anymore that keeps him from talking. His jaw's not wired shut. He's ten years old. He can use his words. But we circle around him like he's still the baby he used to be. We change plans, go to plan B, interrupt conversations, go back on promises depending on his moods, his whims, his needs. That was fine when he was little. But he needs to grow up now. We need to let him, help him, make him grow up. Here's what I think: we've all spent so much time trying to make August think he's normal that he actually thinks he is normal.

There weren't a lot of people who were equipped to babysit for Auggie, so Mom and Dad brought him to all my class plays and concerts and recitals, all the school functions, the bake sales and the book fairs. My friends knew him. My friends' parents knew him. My teachers knew him. The janitor knew him. (\"Hey, how ya doin', Auggie?\" he'd always say, and give August a high five.)

I had forgotten that Mom had called Miranda's mother the night before to ask if she could drive me home from school. \"You don't have to,\" I answered instinctively, casually. \"My mom can pick me up.\" \"I thought she had to pick Auggie up or something.\" \"It turns out she can pick me up afterward. She just texted me. Not a problem.\" \"Oh. Okay.\" \"Thanks.\"",

I had always found his obsession with everything Star Wars kind of geeky, and that braid in the back of his hair, with its little beads, was just awful. But he had always been so proud of it, of how long it took him to grow it, of how he had chosen the beads himself in a crafts store in Soho. He and Christopher, his best friend, used to play with lightsabers and Star Wars stuff whenever they got together, and they had both started growing their braids at the same time. When August cut his braid off that night, without an explanation, without telling me beforehand (which was surprising)—or even calling Christopher—I was just so upset I can't even explain why.",

Not real fun, of course, since I'd heard him brag to people that he had a \"fifteen-year-old who is reading Tolstoy.\" But he liked to rib me about where I was in the book, in a war part or in a peace part, and if there was anything in there about Napoleon's days as a hip-hop dancer.

Her hand was on the doorknob, her forehead leaning on the door, which was ajar. She wasn't going in his room or stepping out: just standing right outside the door, as if she was listening to the sound of his breathing as he slept. The hallway lights were out. The only thing illuminating her was the blue nightlight in August's bedroom. She looked ghostlike standing there. Or maybe I should say angelic. I tried to walk back into my room without disturbing her, but she heard me and walked over to me.",

Not a one. But after August was born, my parents underwent genetic counseling. They were told that August had what seemed to be a \"previously unknown type of mandibulofacial dysostosis caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the TCOF1 gene, which is located on chromosome 5, complicated by a hemifacial microsomia characteristic of OAV spectrum.\" Sometimes these mutations occur during pregnancy. Sometimes they're inherited from one parent carrying the dominant gene. Sometimes they're caused by the interaction of many genes, possibly in combination with environmental factors. This is called multifactorial inheritance. In August's case, the doctors were able to identify one of the \"single nucleotide deletion mutations\" that made war on his face. The weird thing is, though you'd never know it from looking at them: both my parents carry that mutant gene.",

All those times August was clinging to life after a surgery, all those rush trips to the ER: Grans had always been there for Mom. It felt good to cry with Mom. For both of us. At some point, Mom had the idea of our watching The Ghost and Mrs. Muir together, which was one of our all-time favorite black-and white movies. I agreed that that was a great idea. I think I probably would have used this weeping session as an opportunity to tell Mom everything that was going on at school with Miranda and Ella, but just as we were sitting down in front of the DVD player, the phone rang.",

Even though I was well beyond the trick-or-treating stage myself, I usually threw on some mask or other to accompany him up and down the blocks, watching him knocking on people's doors, giddy with excitement. I knew it was the one night a year when he could truly be like every other kid. No one knew he was different under the mask. To August, that must have felt absolutely amazing.",
