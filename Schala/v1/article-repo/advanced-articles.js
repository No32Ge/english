Albert Einstein faced numerous setbacks throughout his life before becoming the superstar scientist. As a child, he was so slow in learning to talk that his parents, Herman and Pauline Einstein, consulted a doctor. Einstein credited his delayed development with fostering his genius, as he approached abstract concepts like space and time later in life. In his words, consequently, I probed more deeply into the problem than an ordinary child would have.",

Despite not believing in a personal God, Einstein embraced the idea of a divine order underlying the universe, reflected in the orderliness of nature. He believed that quantum mechanics, while groundbreaking, was incomplete as it left aspects of reality to chance and introduced probabilistic principles. He was particularly troubled by the strange phenomenon called quantum entanglement, in which two particles instantaneously influence each other no matter how far apart they are.",
