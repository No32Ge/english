Yeah. Pause. Oh. Sure. Long pause. Ohhh. Uh-huh. Pause. Well, that's so nice of you to say. Pause. Sure. Ohh. Wow. Ohhhh. Super long pause. I see, of course. I'm sure he will.

Before, when I was hanging out with August all the time, kids weren't hanging out with me because they'd have to hang out with him. Or they would keep things from me, like the whole thing about the Plague. I think I was the only one who wasn't in on it, except for Summer and maybe the D&D crowd. And the truth is, though nobody's that obvious about it: nobody wants to hang out with him. Everyone's way too hung up on being in the popular group, and he's just as far from the popular group as you can get.",
                "cn": "这样做的好处是，我现在可以和更多的孩子一起玩了。以前，当我一直和奥古斯特一起玩的时候，孩子们不和我玩，因为那样他们就得和他一起玩。或者他们会对我隐瞒一些事情，比如关于“瘟疫”的整件事。我想我是唯一一个不知情的人，除了萨默和可能玩《龙与地下城》的那群人。而事实是，尽管没人表现得那么明显：没人想和他一起玩。每个人都太过执着于进入受欢迎的团体，而他离受欢迎的团体要多远有多远。",

They say a little kid broke his neck while sledding down that hill a few years ago, but I don't know if this is actually true or just one of those legends. On the way home, I spotted this banged-up wooden sled kind of propped up against the Old Indian Rock monument. Dad said to leave it, it was just garbage, but something told me it would make the greatest sled ever. So Dad let me drag it home, and I spent the rest of the day fixing it up. I super-glued the broken slats together and wrapped some heavy-duty white duct tape around them for extra strength. Then I spray painted the whole thing white with the paint I had gotten for the Alabaster Sphinx I was making for the Egyptian Museum project. When it was all dry, I painted LIGHTNING in gold letters on the middle piece of wood, and I made a little lightning-bolt symbol above the letters. It looked pretty professional, I have to say.",

August's holiday card was of a cute old dog wearing reindeer antlers, a red nose, and red booties. There was a cartoon bubble above the dog's head that read: \"Ho-Ho-Ho!\" On the inside of the card it read: To the Will family, Peace on Earth. Love, Nate, Isabel, Olivia, August (and Daisy)",
                "cn": "说也奇怪，当我们回到家，妈妈拿进邮件时，里面有朱利安家和奥古斯特家两家的节日贺卡。朱利安的节日贺卡是朱利安打着领带的照片，看起来像要去歌剧院之类的。奥古斯特的节日贺卡是一只可爱的老狗，戴着驯鹿角、一个红鼻子和红色的小靴子。狗的头顶上有一个卡通对话框，上面写着：“嗬-嗬-嗬！” 卡片里面写着：致威尔一家，世界和平。爱你们的，内特、伊莎贝尔、奥利维亚、奥古斯特（还有黛西）",

I am writing to let you know that my husband and I support your decision to allow Jack to return to Beecher Prep after a two-day suspension. Although I think hitting a child would be valid grounds for expulsion in other schools, I agree such extreme measures aren't warranted here. We have known the Will family since our boys were in kindergarten, and are confident that every measure will be taken to ensure this doesn't happen again.\n\nTo that end, I wonder if Jack's unexpectedly violent behavior might have been a result of too much pressure being placed on his young shoulders? I am speaking specifically of the new child with special needs who both Jack and Julian were asked to \"befriend.\" In retrospect, and having now seen the child in question at various school functions and in the class pictures, I think it may have been too much to ask of our children to be able to process all that. Certainly, when Julian mentioned he was having a hard time befriending the boy, we told him he was \"off the hook\" in that regard. We think the transition to middle school is hard enough without having to place greater burdens or hardships on these young, impressionable minds. I should also mention that, as a member of the school board, I was a little disturbed that more consideration was not given during this child's application process to the fact that Beecher Prep is not an inclusion school. There are many parents—myself included—who question the decision to let this child into our school at all. At the very least, I am somewhat troubled that this child was not held to the same stringent application standards (i.e. interview) that the rest of the incoming middle-school students were.\n\nBest,\nMelissa Perper Albans",

Were I not convinced that Jack Will is extremely sorry for his actions, and were I not confident that he would not repeat those actions, rest assured that I would not be allowing him back to Beecher Prep.\n\nAs for your other concerns regarding our new student August, please note that he does not have special needs. He is neither disabled, handicapped, nor developmentally delayed in any way, so there was no reason to assume anyone would take issue with his admittance to Beecher Prep—whether it is an inclusion school or not. In terms of the application process, the admissions director and I both felt it within our right to hold the interview off-site at August's home for reasons that are obvious. We felt that this slight break in protocol was warranted but in no way prejudicial—in one way or another—to the application review. August is an extremely good student, and has secured the friendship of some truly exceptional young people, including Jack Will.\n\nAt the beginning of the school year, when I enlisted certain children to be a \"welcoming committee\" to August, I did so as a way of easing his transition into a school environment. I did not think asking these children to be especially kind to a new student would place any extra \"burdens or hardships\" on them. In fact, I thought it would teach them a thing or two about empathy, and friendship, and loyalty.\n\nAs it turns out, Jack Will didn't need to learn any of these virtues—he already had them in abundance.\n\nThank you again for being in touch.\n\nSincerely,\nLawrence Tushman",

In fact, things were totally weird from the second I got to my locker in the morning. I'm next to Amos, who's always been a pretty straight-up kid, and I was like, \"Yo, what up?\" and he basically just nodded a half hello and closed his locker door and left. I was like, okay, that was bizarre. And then I said: \"Hey, what up?\" to Henry, who didn't even bother half-smiling but just looked away. Okay, so something's up. Dissed by two people in less than five minutes. Not that anyone's counting. I thought I'd try one more time, with Tristan, and boom, same thing. He actually looked nervous, like he was afraid of talking to me.",
